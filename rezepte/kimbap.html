        <h3><u>Anleitung:</u></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take your napa cabbage and slice in half lengthwise. Cut each of those halves and cut in half again, making quarters. Cut each of those quarters into 1-inch wide strips. </li>
                <li>Take your cabbage and place into a large bowl, heavily seasoning it with kosher salt. Squeeze and toss your cabbage really hard, bruising it. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the cabbage is sitting, take your green onions and cut the root bottoms off. Cut the onion into ½-inch segments. Take your carrots and roughly chop them julienne style. Next, peel your medium-sized daikon and cut them like your carrots, but a thicker julienne chop. </li>
                <li>To make your paste, slice your 2-inch segment of peeled ginger and place into a food processor. Peel and chop an asian pear into cubes and add to the processor. Add in 6 cloves of peeled garlic, and a ¼ cup of fish sauce. Blend until smooth.</li>
                <li>Transfer paste to a medium-sized bowl and mix together with korean red pepper flakes.</li>
                <li>After your cabbage has been sitting, drain through a colander and rinse with water while squeezing at the same time. Toss and squeeze until you’ve washed off the majority of the salt. </li>
                <li>Add your cabbage and all of the vegetables you cut into a large bowl. From there, add in all of your paste and toss to thoroughly coat. Once evenly coated, pack contents into a ½ gallon glass jar that is large enough to fit the mixture. Using a spoon or muddler, press down all of the vegetables so it is packed together, removing any air bubbles in there.</li>
                <li>Loosely cap the jar off, making sure you don’t tighten it all the way down (for it to release gas) and let it sit for 4-7 days. Make sure to press it throughout this time to remove air bubbles that form throughout.</li>
                <li>Once your kimchi has reached the desired flavor point, tighten the cap all the way and store it in the refrigerator.</li>
            </ol>
